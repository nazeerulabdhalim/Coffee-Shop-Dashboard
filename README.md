## **Deep Dive Insights**

### üìà **Revenue & Trends**
- Strong upward trend in revenue from Feb to Jun (+118% increase).
- Growth suggests increasing customer engagement or expanded product adoption.

### üè™ **Store Performance**
- Filters allow comparison, but combined insights show all stores share similar category dominance (Coffee, Tea, Bakery).
- Hell‚Äôs Kitchen likely benefits more from morning rush hour (offices & commuters).

### üïí **Time of Day Analysis**
- Peak transactions between 8am‚Äì11am reflect morning commuter and office worker routines.
- After 11am, sales decline significantly, indicating reliance on morning routines.

### ü•ê Product Category & Product-Level Insights
- Coffee dominates with ~39% of all transactions, followed by Tea and Bakery.
- Flavours, Coffee Beans, Loose Tea, Branded Items, and Packaged Chocolate are niche categories (<5% combined).
- Top 3 products (Brewed Chai Tea, Barista Espresso, Gourmet Brewed Coffee) generate nearly 35% of total revenue.
- Items like Sugar-Free Syrup ($2.3K) and Packaged Chocolate (487 transactions) underperform, raising questions of whether to discontinue or reposition.

## **Recommendations**

### 1. Strengthen Morning Rush Strategy
- Enhance promotions, bundle deals (e.g., coffee + pastry), and quick-service options between 7am‚Äì11am to maximize peak demand.

### 2. Expand Coffee & Tea Offerings
- Invest more in coffee innovation (seasonal brews, specialty lattes) since it drives majority revenue.
- Introduce premium tea blends to expand the already strong tea category.

### 3. Reposition or Rationalize Low-Performing Items
- Reassess niche categories like packaged chocolate and syrups. Consider discontinuing or repackaging them as add-ons in bundles.

### 4. Leverage Data-Driven Promotions
- Use weekday stability to run loyalty programs targeting repeat office-goers.
- Weekends show slightly lower engagement; targeted campaigns (family bundles, brunch promos) could lift weekend sales.

### 5. Inventory & Supply Chain Optimization
- Ensure sufficient stock of top 5 products (Brewed Chai Tea, Barista Espresso, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Brewed Black Tea).
- Reduce overstock on low-turnover items to cut holding costs.

### 6. Store-Specific Strategy
- Customize offerings per location: e.g., quick ‚Äúgrab-and-go‚Äù options in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen (commuters) vs. premium sit-down beverages in Lower Manhattan.
- Revise operating hours for each stores to tailor based on demands.
